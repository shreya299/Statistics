#Question #1
(16 marks) The managers of many stores claim that despite relatively 
constant sales, profits this year are greater than last year.
They have achieved this by improving their supply chain and distribution operations.
Read in the Store.Profits dataset that gives the profits over two years for 15 randomly selected stores.

#find difference between this year and last year

#i.	(3 marks) Explain why you chose your test (two-sample (Welch‚Äôs, pooled, or paired test) by referring to the assumptions/conditions required for the test you chose 
#To test whether there is a significant difference in profits between the two years for the 15 randomly selected stores, I would choose a paired t-test.
"The paired t-test is appropriate because we are comparing profits from the same stores over two different years, making it a paired design. The assumptions/conditions required for a paired t-test are:
Independence: The paired observations (year one and year two profits for each store) are assumed to be independent of each other.
Normality: The population of the paired differences (year two profits - year one profits) should be approximately normally distributed.
Homogeneity of Variances: The variances of the paired differences should be approximately equal.

#Question #2
(4 marks)  Case Study 1 Check Point  Do you think that you should use the two-sample t-test (Welch‚Äôs),
pooled t-test, or paired t-test to determine
if your average hours studied are greater in the Winter 2022 semester than the Fall 2021 semester?
Explain your reasoning in your own words (explain any conditions that you check and if they are met).
Upload your personalized data set to the assignment drop box.

"
The appropriate t-test to determine if the average hours studied are greater in the W22 term 
than the S23 term would be the two-sample t-test (Welch's t-test).

Reasoning:
1.Independent Samples: The two datasets, one for the W22 term and one for the S23 term.
The hours studied in each term are independent of each other as they are measured on different dates.
2.Unequal Variances: They do not have equal variances between the two terms, as the hours studied in
each term are unequal.Therefore, assuming equal variances, as in a pooled t-test, may not be appropriate.
3.Different Sample Sizes: The sample sizes for the W22 term and S23 term are different, as not all dates have recorded data for both terms.
This further supports the use of Welch's t-test, which accounts for unequal sample sizes.
4.Comparing Means: The objective is to compare the average hours studied between the W22 term and the S23 term.
The paired t-test would be used if we were comparing the same individuals' study hours before and after a particular event, but in this case, we are comparing two independent groups.

Conditions Met:
It is assumed that the data meets the conditions required for a t-test, such as the data being approximately normally distributed and the samples being random and representative of the population.
In conclusion, based on the given data, the appropriate t-test to determine if the average hours studied are greater in the W22 term than the S23 term is the two-sample t-test (Welch's t-test), which accounts for unequal variances and different sample sizes between the two terms.
