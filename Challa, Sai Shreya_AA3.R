#Question #1		
1.	(17 marks) The data set ‚Äúmpg.csv‚Äù provided in Moodle gives the number of miles per gallon (mpg) for a random sample
of U.S. cars vs. Japanese cars.
We would like to test the hypothesis that Japanese cars get better mileage than U.S. cars at Œ± = 0.01.

mean_us<-mean(us_cars$Mileage)#15.8

japancars<-subset(mpgdata,Country=="JAPAN",select = c(Mileage,Country))
mean_jp<-mean(japancars$Mileage)#25.8

#Japanese cars seemS to get better MEAN mileage

#a.	(2 marks) State the null and alternative hypothesis
#Null Hypothesis #no difference in the mean mileage between Japanese and US cars.
#HO: Mu_japan-Mu_us=0


#Alternative hypothesis #true difference in means between group JAPAN and group US is greater than 0
#HA: Mu_japan-Mu_us>0

#b.	(3 marks) Check all assumptions and conditions for performing a two-sample t-test.
#Are they satisfied? Include histograms for the mileage in each country to check the nearly normal condition. 

#Independence: The cars in each group are independent of each other.

#Equal variances: The variances of mileage in each group are equal.
#Randomization: The data set is described as a random sample, so this assumption is met.
#Independent groups:two groupsof US and Japan we are comparing are independent of each other.
#Normality: The distribution of mileage in each group is checked using histograms .
#Create histograms

#Question #2	
 Can you use the two-sample t-test for the mean to determine if your average hours 
 studied are greater in the Spring 2022 semester than the Winter 2022 semester? 
 Explain your reasoning. If you believe the test is valid, conduct it using the t.test() 
 function at alpha = 0.05. Upload your personalized data set to the assignment drop box.

#Equal variances: The variances of mileage in each group should be equal.
#Randomization: The data set is described as a personal data set and not random sample, so this assumption is not met.

#Normality: The distribution of mileage in each group is checked using histograms .
