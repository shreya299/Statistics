#Question #1
1.	(18 marks) Most professional baseball players are born in August. 
It has been suggested that children born in the summer have a better chance 
of making it to the professional leagues than their peers perhaps because 
they can be outdoors when they are young or due to the cut off dates for 
children entering baseball leagues (July 31 in the United States). The data 
in the table report the number of professional ballplayers born in each month
of the year for a random sample of professional baseball players. We would 
like to determine if this observed distribution of players born in each month
is significantly different than what we would expect if players birthdays 
were equally distributed across the year. 
a.	(2 marks) State the null and alterative hypothesis for the chi-square
goodness of fit test.
b.	(2 marks) Create vectors for the observed birthdays in each month and 
expected birthdays in each month. What is the expected number of birthdays 
per month under the null hypothesis? 
c.	(5 marks) Conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test at Î± = 0.05 and 
decide to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis (using the p-value
or critical value). Interpret your decision in the context of the problem. 
d.	(1 mark) Calculate and print out the standardized residuals for each
month. 
e.	 (4 marks) Create a bar plot that shows the residual values.
Are there any unusual values? Specifically comment on which unusual values are above the mean and which are below the mean. 
f.	(4 marks) Create a grouped bar plot to show the observed and expected 
distributions for birthdays in each month. Are more players born in August? 
Explain using the plot.
