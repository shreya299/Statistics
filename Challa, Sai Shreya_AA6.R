#Question #1
15 marks) A pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug that they believe increases focus and 
attention. To test this hypothesis, the company obtains 27 volunteers and randomly assigns 9 to each 
of three groups. The first group receives a placebo. The second group receives 50mg of the drug. 
The third group receives 100mg of the drug. After taking the treatment, participants complete a 
computerized focus task to measure their level of focus and attention. The percentage accuracy for 
each participant is shown in the table. You must recreate this table in R (HINT: use data.frame() 
or cbind()).

#Question #2
The data set Combined.csv contains the hours studied by past analytics students. 
Test the hypothesis that the mean number of hours studied is the same for all three programs 
(Business = BAPG, Crime = CAGC, and Health = HAGC). Prepare your data for analysis by completing 
the following steps: Divide the data into subsets by program, making separate data sets 
for students in the BAPG, CAGC, and HAGC programs. Take a random sample of 50 days from 
each subset using the sample_n() function from the dplyr package. Perform an ANOVA to test 
your hypothesis (HINT: think about what format the data set needs to be in for ANOVA). 
State your final conclusion regarding the null hypothesis and interpret the results.
